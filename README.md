## Overview 

Gooey Video is a small collection of the FFMPEG tools I use while working on [Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey). It handles:  

 * Screen recording 
 * GIF conversion 
 * General Trim/Crop/Scaling utils 
 * Timelapse / Slideshow creation 
 * Watermarking  

This is not aimed at being a general purpose UI for FFMPEG. Its library aspirations climb only to the heights of: moderately useful for specific work flows.     

## Installation and Quick Start 

You can `pip install` the project from source. _Be warned_, the [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) binary is attached, which makes the installation footprint a whopping 70mb! 

```
pip install git+https://github.com/chriskiehl/GooeyVideo.git
```
